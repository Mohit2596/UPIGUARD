# 🛡️ UPIGUARD — Real-Time UPI Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

UPIGUARD is a full-stack fraud detection system that analyses UPI transactions in **real time** and assigns a Fraud Probability Score (0–100%) before the transaction is finalised — flagging suspicious transfers as Low, Medium, or High risk.

Built as a Final Year Project (B.Tech CSE-IoT), designed with an industry-style microservice architecture rather than a single monolithic script.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most existing fraud detection systems flag fraud **after** money has already left the account. UPIGUARD analyses each transaction **before** it completes, giving users and admins immediate visibility into risk.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Three independently deployable microservices:
React Frontend (Port 3000)
              │
              ▼
Spring Boot Backend (Port 8080) ──JWT Auth + RBAC + MySQL
              │
              ▼
Python FastAPI ML Service (Port 8000) ──Random Forest Model - **Frontend:** React.js + Bootstrap 5 — SPA with protected/admin routes
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot + Spring Security (JWT) + Spring Data JPA
- **ML Service:** Python FastAPI serving a trained Random Forest model
- **Database:** MySQL with Hibernate/JPA

Each service can be developed, scaled, and deployed independently.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (300 trees, max_depth=20)
- **Features:** 14 engineered features — transaction amount (log-normalised), time-of-day signals, weekend/night flags, same-bank vs cross-bank, and a composite `risk_score`
- **Performance:** 78.5% accuracy · 88.36% ROC-AUC · 90% fraud recall
- **Output:** `predict_proba()` gives a continuous fraud probability (0–100%) instead of a binary yes/no

---

## 🔐 Security

- JWT-based stateless authentication
- BCrypt password hashing
- Role-Based Access Control (USER / ADMIN)
- CORS configured for frontend-backend communication
- SQL injection prevention via Spring Data JPA (parameterised queries)
